# K-Means Clustering Application

This application, written in C#, demonstrates the K-Means clustering algorithm. It allows you to input coordinates either from a text file or by clicking on the panel. The text file should contain coordinates in the following format:

```
10,20
30,40
55,66
```

The coordinates should be within the range of 800 for the x-coordinate and 600 for the y-coordinate.

## Getting Started

To get started with the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:
   - .NET Framework (version X.X or higher)
   - C# compiler
3. Build the project using your preferred build tool or IDE.

## Usage

### Inputting Coordinates from a Text File

1. Prepare a text file containing the coordinates in the specified format.
2. Launch the application.
3. In the application interface, click on the "Load Coordinates from File" button.
4. Select the text file containing the coordinates when prompted.
5. The application will process the coordinates and display the results.

### Inputting Coordinates by Clicking on the Panel

1. Launch the application.
2. In the application interface, click on the panel to input coordinates.
3. Click on the desired location within the panel.
4. Repeat step 3 to add more coordinates.
5. Once you have inputted all the coordinates, click on the "Process" button.
6. The application will run the K-Means clustering algorithm and display the results.
